  **With four years of experience as an operating room nurse, driven by passion and responsibility, I am now embarking on a new challenge with boldness and determination.**
  I have begun my Master's in <mark>Nursing Informatics</mark>(Community and Nursing Care System) at Seoul National University, where I am expanding my expertise at the intersection of nursing and technology.
  As a Research Assistant at the <mark>Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Lab (HCAIL)</mark>, I aim to integrate human-computer interaction into nursing practice, leveraging my clinical experience to develop tools that enhance nursing professionalism and address healthcare disparities.
  I look forward to filling the pages ahead with impactful projects and research. **Would you like to be part of this journey?**
